# slots-game
DESCRIPTION
This is a small game I made as my first project in Java. It is a slot machine game with a consistent level of points that can be spent at 
the store to buy (useless) items or spent on more plays at the slot machine. 

HOW TO PLAY
Run newSlotsRun.bat, after which the console should pop up with the game running. From there, follow the menus through the game by 
inputting numbers to the console. 
Exit the game by going back to the main menu and inputting 3.
